Artificial intelligence is becoming as common as everyday tools, helping people learn, create, and communicate. Just like animals such as cats, dogs, and wolves share certain traits, many words in language also share internal patterns. Machines try to capture these patterns by learning embeddings that place similar ideas close together. For example, the words “happy,” “joyful,” and “delighted” often appear in similar contexts, while “run,” “walk,” and “jump” relate to actions. Even technology words like “computer,” “network,” and “model” form their own cluster. By exploring these relationships, we can visualize how meaning emerges in vector space.
